      <h2>Cathrine</h2>
      <p>
        Meet Cathrine, our stellar design lead! Cathrine enjoys making fun of
        people, collecting erasers and doesn’t suffer fools gladly. Her zoom
        backgrounds are the stuff of legends.
      </p>
      <img src="../photos/sam.jpeg" />
      <h2>Sam</h2>
      <p>
        Meet Sam, our product manager who keeps our app on track! An avid kung
        fu practitioner who practices and teaches kung fu on a daily basis, Sam
        collects Lego, like monkeys and hopes to live a secluded mountain life
        with his beloved girlfriend.

      <h2>Vanessa</h2>
      <p>
        Meet Vanessa, our project manager extraordinaire! She keeps us on track
        and on time. This marketer turned developer loves to make clothes and
        cake, often asks questions before realizing she knows the answer, and is
        irritatingly grateful
      </p>

      <h2>Clifford</h2>
      <p>
        Meet Cliffie (boy, does he wish you would call him Ford!), our tech
        lead. When he’s not bossing us around, he loves jamming to Fergalicious,
        Brunch, Banana Bread and Seth Rogan. Ask him to tell you the story about
        jelly beans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team is composed of Cathrine Carreon, Samuel Scott, Clifford Roecker
        and Vanessa Bastien. When tasked with the job of meeting Kung Fu
        instructors’ need for a better way to track their students achievements
        and goals, the ideas started swirling! Steadily, this team worked
        through goals and blockers to create the finished product before you.
        Each member used their strengths and skills and gained a few new ones,
        too. They proudly present their work, and welcome comments and
        suggestions on improvements in the future.
